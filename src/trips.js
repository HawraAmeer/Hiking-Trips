    description: `Our Mountains to Fjords Hut to Hut Trek is an incredible way to explore Norway’s best landscapes and most famous National Park, Jotunheimen. This Park boasts the highest mountains not only in Norway, but all of Northern Europe; the name Jotunheimen literally means “home of the giants.”

    Utilizing Norway’s fantastic hut system, we intimately enjoy the Park and all of its spectacular trails and jaw dropping vistas. After soaking up panoramic mountain views for days, we take you on a visit to one of Norway’s other famous natural features, the Nærøyfjord. This spot is so amazing and unique it is featured on UNESCO’s World Heritage List, and we are proud to enjoy it via a sustainable, zero emissions cruise.
    
    Also, this trip starts in the capital city of Oslo and ends in the charming town of Bergen, so we have the opportunity to see a large swath of Norway and learn about its many traditions and rich cultural history in one spectacular hiking-centered itinerary. Come explore the land of the Vikings with us on foot!`,
